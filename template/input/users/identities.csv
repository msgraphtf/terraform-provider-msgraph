Setting or updating a `userPrincipalName` identity will update the value of the **userPrincipalName** property on the user object. The validations performed on the `userPrincipalName` property on the user object, for example, verified domains and acceptable characters, will be performed when setting or updating a `userPrincipalName` identity. Additional validation is enforced on **issuerAssignedId** when the sign-in type is set to `emailAddress` or `userName`. This property can also be set to any custom string.
