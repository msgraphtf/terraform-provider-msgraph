To set this attribute, use one of the following valid string values: None, SecurityGroup (for security groups and Microsoft Entra roles), All (this gets all of the security groups, distribution groups, and Microsoft Entra directory roles that the signed-in user is a member of).
- `identifier_uris` (List of String) Also known as App ID URI, this value is set when an application is used as a resource app. The identifierUris acts as the prefix for the scopes you reference in your API's code, and it must be globally unique. You can use the default value provided, which is in the form api://<appId>, or specify a more readable URI like https://contoso.com/api. For more information on valid identifierUris patterns and best practices, see Microsoft Entra application registration security best practices. Not nullable. Supports $filter (eq, ne, ge, le, startsWith).
- `info` (Attributes) Basic profile information of the application such as  app's marketing, support, terms of service and privacy statement URLs. The terms of service and privacy statement are surfaced to users through the user consent experience. For more info, see How to: Add Terms of service and privacy statement for registered Microsoft Entra apps. Supports $filter (eq, ne, not, ge, le, and eq on null values).

- `required_resource_access` (Attributes List) Specifies the resources that the application needs to access. This property also specifies the set of delegated permissions and application roles that it needs for each of those resources. This configuration of access to the required resources drives the consent experience. No more than 50 resource services (APIs) can be configured. Beginning mid-October 2021, the total number of required permissions must not exceed 400. For more information, see Limits on requested permissions per app. Not nullable. Supports $filter (eq, not, ge, le). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--required_resource_access))
